#Workflow

##Definition
A workflow consists of an orchestrated and repeatable pattern of business activity enabled by the systematic organization of resources into processes that transform materials, provide services, or process information. It can be depicted as a sequence of operations, declared as work of a person or group, an organization of staff, or one or more simple or complex mechanisms.

From a more abstract or higher-level perspective, workflow may be considered a view or representation of real work. The flow being described may refer to a document, service or product that is being transferred from one step to another.

Workflows may be viewed as one fundamental building block to be combined with other parts of an organization's structure such as information technology, teams, projects and hierarchies.

##Historical development
The development of the concept of workflow occurred above a series of loosely defined, overlapping eras.

###Beginnings in manufaturing
The modern history of workflows can be traced to Frederick Taylor and Henry Gantt, although the term 'workflow' was not in usage as such during their lifetimes. One of the earliest usages of the term 'work flow' was in a railway engineering journal from 1921.

Taylor and Gantt launched the study of the deliberate, rational organization of work, primarily in the context of manufacturing. This gave rise to time and motion studies. Related concepts include job shops and queuing systems (Markov chains).

The 1948 book Cheaper by the Dozen introduced the emerging concepts to the context of family life. 

###Maturation and growth

The invention of the typewriter and the copier helped spread the study of the rational organization of labor from the manufacturing shop floor to the office. Filing systems and other sophisticated systems for managing physical information flows evolved. Two events provided a huge impetus to the development of formalized information workflows. First, the field of optimization theory matured and developed mathematical optimization techniques. Second, World War II and the Apollo program were unprecedented in their demands for the rational organization of work.

###Quality era

In the post-war era, the work of W. Edwards Deming and Joseph M. Juran led to a focus on quality, initially in Japanese companies, and from the 1980s on a more global level, giving rise to a variety of movements ranging from total quality management to Six Sigma, then to more qualitative notions of business process re-engineering. Under the influence of the quality movement, workflows, in knowledge economy sectors  as well as in manufacturing, became the subject of further scrutiny and optimization efforts. Acknowledgement of the dynamic and changing nature of the demands on workflows came in the form of recognition of the phenomena associated with critical paths and moving bottlenecks.

##Workflow management system
A workflow management system (WfMS) is a software system for the set-up, performance and monitoring of a defined sequence of tasks, arranged as a workflow.

##Examples
The following examples illustrate the variety of workflows seen in various contexts:

- 1.In machine shops, particularly job shops and flow shops, the flow of a part through the various processing stations is a work flow.

- 2.Insurance claims processing is an example of an information-intensive, document-driven workflow.

- 3.Wikipedia editing can be modeled as a stochastic workflow.

- 4.The Getting Things Done system is a model of personal workflow management for information workers.

- 5.In software development, support and other industries, the concept of follow-the-sun describes a process of passing unfinished work across time zones.

- 6.In traditional offset and digital printing, the concept of workflow represents the process, people and usually software technology (RIPs raster image processors or DFE digital front end) controllers that play a part in pre/post processing of print-related files. e.g. PDF pre-flight checking to make certain that fonts are embedded or that the imaging output to plate or digital press will be able to render the document intent properly for the image-output capabilities of the press that will print the final image.

- 7.In scientific experiments, the overall process (tasks and data flow) can be described as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This DAG is referred to as a workflow, e.g. Brain Imaging workflows.

- 8.In healthcare data analysis, a workflow can be used to represent a sequence of steps which compose a complex data analysis (data-search and data-manipulation steps).

- 9.In service-oriented architectures an application can be represented through an executable workflow, where different, possibly geographically distributed, service components interact to provide the corresponding functionality under the control of a workflow management system.

##Workflow improvement theories
Several workflow improvement theories have been proposed and implemented in the modern workplace. These include:

- 1.[Six Sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma)

- 2.[Total Quality Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_quality_management)

- 3.[Business Process Reengineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_reengineering)

- 4.[Lean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing) systems

- 5.[Theory of Constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints)

Evaluation of resources, both physical and human is essential to evaluate hand-off points and potential to create smoother transitions between tasks.

##Applications
Many software systems exist to support workflows in particular domains. Such systems manage tasks such as automatic routing, partially automated processing and integraion between different functional software applications and hardware systems that contribute to the value-addition process underlying the workflow. There are also software suppliers using the technology [process driven messaging service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_driven_messaging_service) based upon three elements:

* Standard Objects
* Workflow Objects
* Workflow

##Tools

[Flowcharts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart) and [process maps](https://www.isixsigma.com/tools-templates/process-mapping/) are useful tools for visualizing the number and order of steps in a workflow. Flowcharts use simple geometric symbols and arrows to define if/then relationships. Process maps look somewhat similar, but they may also include support information, documenting the resources that each step in a business process requires.
